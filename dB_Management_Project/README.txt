Welcome to my Video Game Library Management Project for THE Tech Academy.

I have created a database for the fictional Library network with the branches:

PHOENIX
EDMUND
PALIUS
PARIS

The idea is to create a working database, 
populate it with data (in this case actual video games in my collection), 
and create some queries to get specific information for my future 'users'.

All my procedures for the drills are in the file labeled as such.
