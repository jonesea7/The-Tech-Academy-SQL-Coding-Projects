joke about outer and inner joins

What do an outer join and a gossip have in common?
They tell what is going on your table, my table, and our 'inner'[join] table put together.

limerick about keys in sql

a key is a tool that you need,
to find lots of records with speed,
you make a key up,
with a key type and stuff,
and tables are connected when f-keyed.


haiku title: the three key types

primary is once
foreign links here to there now
unique says it all

UNIQUE guarantees that a column is populated with unique data.
PRIMARY has a UNIQUE CONSTRAINT within it and can be used by FOREIGN keys to have the table it is in be referenced.
FOREIGN keys allow you reference another table because it has a data set that is IDENTICAL to a data set in the 
	referenced table.

Musical: Getting Real with My Database

UNIQUE_ID: Hi my name is Unique Identifier, and I'd like to sing a song for y'all. I hope you like it.

	Looking out on the [row of data]
	I used to feel so un[realistic]
	And when I knew I had to face another [record set]
	Lord, it made me feel so [simplistic]
	Before the day I met you, [tuples identified me]
	But you[r Social Security number is] the key to my [identity]
	'Cause you make me feel
	You make me feel
	You make me feel like
	A NATURAL [key] ([key])

SIMPLE KEY TRAILER

Coming soon to a theater near you.
One column.
One unique identifier.
No long rows of data.
This fall experience the 'simple' life.

Simple Key
A Random Database Administrator Table 

SIMPLE KEY!
Where the data IS the ID!

MONOLOGUE: I didn't choose to be secondary, I created this way.

col_Email: I want you to know I have been on this table for many years.
I know how to identify the record. I have what it takes. I can uniquely identify each row.
I have a nice column name. The only difference between me and  
Mr. col_Student_ID is you put 'PRIMARY KEY' in your stupid little SQL code next to Mr. ID's column generation.
That's all! I could be a primary key any day. At least I'm not alone. I got col_Roll_No living the secondary key life too.



It's a bird,
It's a plane,
No it's Superkey.

Able to combine two unique identifying columns in a single bound.
Superkey has Mary's Social Security number,
and uniquely generated hexadecimal Employee ID.

What makes Superkey truly amazing is her ability pull these two natural keys together with her super strength.

Superkey
She helps make everyone one of a kind indeed.


LETTER TO PK

Dearest PK,
	I'm lost without you. When you left the table I could no
longer get to my parent's house. It's been crazy without you PK. Come
home. There's no referential integrity without you. I just don't matter
without you. I'm pointless if I don't have you to look to for all the big
queries in life. Come home. We still have a huge column with your name on it.

										Love Always and Referentially,
										Foreign

							P.S. All the Candidate keys are chomping at the bit
							to hook up with me,
							but I only have eyes for you.


where is before the group
having is after the group

where filters records from a result before any groupings
having filters values from a group

so having clause filters what the where clause filters from the table

like the old aphorism says:
"You can't HAVE anything if you don't know WHERE it comes from."

DATABASE INDEX IS A MAP THAT DIAGRAMS THE DATABASE IN A VISUAL FORMAT TO SEE ALL THE KEYS
AND CONNECTIONS OF ALL THE TABLES IN THE DATABASE IN ONE FELL SWOOP.
