# The-Tech-Academy-SQL-Coding-Projects
Projects to complete SQL course as a part of my training with The Tech Academy

The project listed here is library exercise. I have decided to make a database of my personal video
game library and apply it to the assignment from The Tech Academy.



ASSIGNMENT ADJUSTMENT
•	There is a game called 'Kirby’s Epic Yarn’ found in the 'Phoenix’ branch.
•	There is a library branch called ‘Phoenix’ and one called 'Edmund'.
•	There are at least 20 GAMES in the GAME table.
•	There are at least 10 DEVELOPERS in the GAME_DEVELOPERS table.
•	Each library branch has at least 10 GAME titles, and at least two copies of each of those titles.

•	There are at least 4 branches in the LIBRARY_BRANCH table.
•	There are at least 50 loans in the GAME_LOANS table.
•	There must be at least two games developed by ‘Hideo Kojima’ located at the ‘Edmund’ branch.
CREATE STORED PROCEDURES THAT WILL QUERY FOR EACH OF THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: 
•	1.) How many copies of the games titled ‘Kirby’s Epic Yarn’ are owned by the library branch whose name is ‘Phoenix’?
•	2.) How many copies of the game titled ‘Kirby’s Epic Yarn’ are owned by each library branch?
•	3.) Retrieve the names of all borrowers who do not have any games checked out.
•	4.) For each game that is loaned out from the ‘Phoenix’ branch and whose DueDate is today, retrieve the game title, the borrower's name, and the borrower's address.

•	6.) Retrieve the names, addresses, and the number of games checked out for all borrowers who have more than five games checked out.
