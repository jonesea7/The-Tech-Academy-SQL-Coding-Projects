1. If you wish to make a foreign key know that the column you are referencing must be IDENTICAL! That's why it is usually easier to 
  link INT fk to the ID INT PRIMARY KEY
  
2. If you execute a table and then make changes to it without either invoking the ALTER statement or DROP TABLE option your 'new' data
will not show up in the table.
