1. If you wish to make a foreign key know that the column you are referencing must be IDENTICAL! That's why it is usually easier to 
  link INT fk to the ID INT PRIMARY KEY
  
2. If you execute a table and then make changes to it without either invoking the ALTER statement or DROP TABLE option your 'new' data
will not show up in the table.


If you try to create a foreign key remember the data you are referencing must be identical

'Kirbys Epic Yarn' != 'Kirby''s Epic Yarn'

I had this mistake as my first value in two tables that I was trying to reference to the GAME table. The key would not work because I was 
not using the identical piece of data.


Conflict with an fk? ARE THE DATA SETS IDENTICAL

'Smash Brothers Ult' != 'Smash Bros. Ult.'

If you link a foreign key to the unique/primary key when you populate your tables they will show up in alphabetical order???
  IT IS WHEN YOU SET A STRING OR VARCHAR AS A PRIMARY KEY DOES IT ALPHABETIZE THE DATA IN THE STRINGS.


select means what columns do you want to see. as long as they are in the tables you are joining you can see them all.
